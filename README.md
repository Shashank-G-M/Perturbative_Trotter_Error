# Perturbative_Trotter_Error

The repository contains code to implement the research done in the work "Estimating Trotter Approximation Errors to Optimize Hamiltonian Partitioning for Lower Eigenvalue Errors" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13282). We build functionalities to generate fragments of molecular Hamiltonians, calculate exact and approximate Trotter error based on Perturbation theroy, and estimate T gate counts for implementing Quantum Phase Estimation using the second order Trotter approximation. The source code is contained in the package ```pert_trotter```. The google collab notebook ```tutorial.ipynb``` provides a step-by-step procedure to reproduce the results in the paper. Note, for the qubitized fragments of molecules BeH2, H2O, and Nh3, a compute cluster might be needed to obtain some of the quantities.
